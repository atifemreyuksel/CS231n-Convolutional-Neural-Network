Implementations of the assignments of CS231n:Convolutional Neural Network class in Stanford.

In some parts of assignments, I used different techniques to get better solutions regarding weight initialization, reducing the learning rate. These assignments are put to shed a light when someone cannot find the way to solve the exercise.

The solutions of these assignments are the solutions of the assignments of the previous year class.
